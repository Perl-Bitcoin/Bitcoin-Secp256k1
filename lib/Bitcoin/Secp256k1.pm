=head1 NAME

Bitcoin::Secp256k1 - Perl interface to libsecp256k1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Bitcoin::Secp256k1;

	# first, create a context
	my $secp256k1 = Bitcoin::Secp256k1->new;

	# then, use it to perform ECC operations
	my $public_key = $secp256k1->create_public_key($private_key);
	my $signature = $secp256k1->sign_message($private_key, $message);
	my $valid = $secp256k1->verify_message($public_key, $signature, $message);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements XS routines that allow accessing common elliptic curve
operations on secp256k1 curve using Perl code. It requires
L<libsecp256k1|https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1> to be installed on
the system, and will try to detect and install it automatically using
L<Alien::libsecp256k1>.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 Attributes

None - object is a blessed readonly scalar reference with a memory address of a
C structure. As such, it does not contain any attributes accessible directly
from Perl.

=head2 Methods

=head3 new

	$secp256k1 = Bitcoin::Secp256k1->new()

Object constructor. All methods in this package require this object to work
properly. It accepts no arguments.

=head3 verify_private_key

	$valid = $secp256k1->verify_private_key($private_key)

Checks whether bytestring C<$private_key> is a valid private key. Private key
is valid if its length is exactly C<32> and it is below curve order (when
interpreted as a big-endian integer).

Some methods in this module may die if their private key is not valid, but a
chance of picking an invalid 32-byte private key at random are extremely slim.

=head3 create_public_key

	$public_key = $secp256k1->create_public_key($private_key)

Creates a public key from a bytestring C<$private_key> and returns a bytestring
C<$public_key>. C<$private_key> must have exact length of C<32>.

The public key is always returned in compressed form, use L</compress_public_key> to get uncompressed form.

=head3 normalize_signature

	$signature = $secp256k1->normalize_signature($signature)

Performs signature normalization of C<$signature>, which is in DER encoding (a
bytestring). Returns the normalized signature. Will return the same signature
if it was already in a normalized form.

Signature normalization is important because of Bitcoin protocol rules.
Normally, Bitcoin will reject transactions with malleable signatures. This
module will only emit a warning if you try to verify a signature that is not
normalized.

This method lets you both detect whether the signature was malleable and fix it
to avoid a warning if needed.

=head3 compress_public_key

	$public_key = $secp256k1->compress_public_key($public_key, $want_compressed = !!1)

Changes the compression form of bytestring C<$public_key>. If
C<$want_compressed> is a true value (or omitted / undef), method will return
the key in compressed (default) form. If it is a false value, C<$public_key>
will be in uncompressed form. It accepts keys in both compressed and
uncompressed forms.

While both compressed and uncompressed keys will behave the same during
signature verification, they produce different Bitcoin addresses (because
address is a hashed public key).

=head3 sign_message

	$signature = $secp256k1->sign_message($private_key, $message)

Signs C<$message>, which may be a bytestring of any length, with
C<$private_key>, which must be a bytestring of length C<32>. Returns
DER-encoded C<$signature> as a bytestring.

C<$message> is first hashed with double SHA256 (known an HASH256 in Bitcoin)
before passing it to signing algorithm (which expects length C<32> bytestrings).

This method always produces normalized, deterministic signatures suitable to
use inside a Bitcoin transaction.

=head3 sign_digest

	$signature = $secp256k1->sign_digest($private_key, $message_digest)

Same as L</sign_message>, but it does not perform double SHA256 on its input.
Because of that, C<$message_digest> must be a bytestring of length C<32>.

=head3 verify_message

	$valid = $secp256k1->verify_message($public_key, $signature, $message)

Verifies C<$signature> (DER-encoded, bytestring) of C<$message> (bytestring of
any length) against C<$public_key> (compressed or uncompressed, bytestring).
Returns true if verification is successful.

C<$message> is first hashed with double SHA256 (known an HASH256 in Bitcoin)
before passing it to verification algorithm (which expects length C<32> bytestrings).

Raises a warning if C<$siganture> is not normalized. It is recommended to
perform signature normalization using L</normalize_signature> first and either
accept or reject malleable signatures explicitly.

=head3 verify_digest

	$valid = $secp256k1->verify_digest($public_key, $signature, $message_digest)

Same as L</verify_message>, but it does not perform double SHA256 on its input.
Because of that, C<$message_digest> must be a bytestring of length C<32>.

=head3 negate_private_key

	$negated_private_key = $secp256k1->negated_private_key($private_key)

Negates a private key and returns it.

=head3 negate_public_key

	$negated_public_key = $secp256k1->negate_public_key($public_key)

Negates a public key and returns it.

=head3 add_private_key

	$tweaked = $secp256k1->add_private_key($private_key, $tweak)

Add a C<$tweak> (bytestring of length C<32>) to C<$private_key> (bytestring of
length C<32>). The result is a bytestring containing tweaked private key.

If the arguments or the resulting key are not valid, an exception will be thrown.

=head3 add_public_key

	$tweaked = $secp256k1->add_public_key($public_key, $tweak)

Add a C<$tweak> (bytestring of length C<32>) to C<$public_key> (bytestring with
compressed or uncompressed public key). The result is a bytestring containing
tweaked public key in compressed form.

If the arguments or the resulting key are not valid, an exception will be thrown.

=head3 multiply_private_key

	$tweaked = $secp256k1->multiply_private_key($private_key, $tweak)

Same as L</add_private_key>, but performs multiplication instead of addition.

=head3 multiply_public_key

	$tweaked = $secp256k1->multiply_public_key($public_key, $tweak)

Same as L</add_public_key>, but performs multiplication instead of addition.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

The module consists of two layers:

=over

=item

High-level API, which consists of public, stable methods. These methods should
deliver most of the possible use cases for the library, but some paths may not
be covered. All of these methods simply accept and return values without
storing anything inside the object.

=item

Low-level API, which is implemented in XS and private. It interacts directly
with libsecp256k1 and is storing some intermediate state (but never the private
key) in a blessed C structure. It covers all of library's functions which are
valuable in Perl's context. Its existence is only significant to the author and
the contributors.

Notable exceptions are the constructor L</new> and the destructor, which are
also part of the low-level API, yet public.

=back

The module also needs a cryptographically-secure source of pseudo-randomness to
deliver the highest level of security. It will try to obtain it from L<CryptX>
or L<Bytes::Random::Secure>. If none of these modules is installed, a warning
will be issued every time a constructor is called. The library will continue to
work as intended, but randomization is a security feature which protects against
some types of attacks. Refer to libsecp256k1 documentation for details.

=head2 TODO

This module currently covers most usage paths of the base libsecp256k1. In the
future, new methods to also cover some of its optional modules may be
introduces, most notably the Schnorr module.

=head1 CAVEATS

Documentation of libsecp256k1 recommends keeping secrets on the stack (not the
heap) and erasing them manually after they are no longer used. This is
impossible in Perl, as it gives programmer no control over memory allocation.
This library does not ever clear the secret key memory by overwriting it with
zeros. If you need this level of security, you should probably use libsecp256k1
directly in C code.
